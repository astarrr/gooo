# Go and Kafka Personal Side Project

This project is a personal endeavor aimed at learning Go programming language and exploring the Kafka messaging system.
It involves the development of a producer that reads Twitch messages and sends them to Kafka, and two consumers (one in
Go and one in Scala) that
retrieves and processes these messages from Kafka.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, fill the CHANNEL variable with the Twitch channel name in
`docker-compose.yaml` and start the composition:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

## Contributing

This project is open to contributions, suggestions, and improvements.
