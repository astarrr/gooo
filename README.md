# Go and Kafka Personal Side Project

This project is a personal endeavor aimed at learning Go programming language and exploring the Kafka messaging system. It involves the development of a producer that reads Twitch messages and sends them to Kafka, and a Go consumer that retrieves and processes these messages from Kafka.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, just start the composition:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
